Hi! I'm Paul, an aspiring data scientist in Chicago and Metis Alumni. I graduated from Boston University in 2015 with a BA in Anthropology. There I learned to love story telling and narrative construction while I fostered my love for understanding the human experience. After graduation I moved back to my home state of Illinois and started a long journey of "figuring it out". Due to an obsession with all things tech, I taught myself how to code and watched live streams of confrerences until I hit passion-gold with the world of data science and machine learning. Fast forward another year and I'm at Metis learning the toolkit of the data scientist. My past in anthropology gives me a particular fondness for NLP and data viz and a unique approach to playing with and understanding data. Data about human beings, after all, is just another way to tell the stories of our experience. It is a tool for understanding who and what we really are in ways we couldn't possible see from our vantage.
