title: Blank Canvassing -  Week one at Metis DS Bootcamp 
---
This week at Metis we looked at [MTA data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) and moved from green to clean, or, rather, cleaner. For a group of novices with disparate backgrounds this was no simple task and certainly not one we imagined we would finish in five days. But we did! We survived and managed to pull of actual presentations, with actual graphs of actual data! But more importantly, we learned. A lot. And, for the rest of this post, I will share a small portion of this weeks take aways!

## The Premise:  
  
Your team has been contracted out by Women Tech Women Yes (WTWY) International to provide optimal canvasser placement recommendations for an upcoming gala in New York City.  To this end you will use the publicly available [MTA data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) and any other data you deem relevant. The goal is not simply to have street teams placed where there is the most foot traffic, but rather to place them in way such that they can gather the most signatures from individuals who are likely to attend the gala and contribute to WTWY's goal.
